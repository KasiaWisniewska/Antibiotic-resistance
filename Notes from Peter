I asked Peter about depth of the genes and how to match the reads in general

1) Depth has to be at least 10 for the whole gene meaning that every part of it has to have depth >= 10

2) Depth of sequencing in our NGS sample is ~50 which means that the whole genome was sequenced ~50 times. 
That also means that in the perfect scenario, if a resistance gene is present, its depth will be ~50. 
It will be lower due to sequencing errors

3) We need to match whole reads to the resistance gene, not just separate k-mers. Even though 19-mer
should be unique, we have to exclude the chance for a random match of a k-mer from an irrelevant read
